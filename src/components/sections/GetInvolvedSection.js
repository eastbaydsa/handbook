              The way our active members become active members is usually, “show
              up to meetings, then take on work.” We have a variety of meetings
              every month: Each of them should include opportunities for members
              to dig into ongoing projects. (And if they don’t, feel free to
              email{" "}

              We think of all DSA members as socialist organizers (that’s what
              it says on your membership card!), but at the same time we know
              that almost no one comes to DSA a fully formed socialist
              organizer. Organizing requires us all to develop a variety of
              skills: being able to map out a social group, identifying natural
              leaders, figuring out what people need to hear in order to bring
              their best, and making courageous asks. These are skills you can
              apply inside the organization as you get your feet under you, but
              also outside of it: figuring out what friends to invite to which
              events, testing which appeals work on your uncle at Thanksgiving,
              and otherwise advancing socialism through honest conversations.
              Organizing also requires practical skills like being reliable,
              organized, and communicative about your limits and your
              availability.

                There is a spectre haunting NorCal: the spectre of flakiness.
                People say “We should meet up!” and never follow through.
                Good-sounding ideas are tossed around without serious
                consideration of what it would take to make them happen. (And
                let’s not even TALK about online dating.) This is undoubtedly a
                consequence of living in a society where we’re taught to be
                consumers instead of a community and where the prevailing ethos
                is “You don’t owe anyone anything.” We’ve all been guilty of
                this, at one point or another, but if we are going to seriously
                build a structure strong enough to remake the world, we need to
                show up on time for meetings.

                In this organization, what you do matters. We might be socially
                conditioned to window-shop every single possible choice until
                the last minute, but that doesn’t foster a strong organization.
                Commit to something, and hold to it.

                We’re not asking you to martyr yourself because that’s how
                burnout happens. Don’t take on more than you can sustain. We
                also recognize that not everyone has a few extra hours per week
                because capitalism is awful. Just do what you can. You’re not
                going to get fired or yelled at if you get overwhelmed or drop
                the ball every once in awhile. But when you honor people’s time
                and energy, you build trust.{" "}

              when we have a strong body of activities that stitch us together

              Find the committee (or caucus) doing the organizing closest to
              your idea, get involved with their ongoing work, and once you have
              the lay of the land, ask some of the organizers to talk it over
              with you. The more you can take on the logistical work surrounding
              your idea (and round up previously inactive members or interested
              non-members to help), the more likely you are to make it happen
              quickly.

              If you want to gather folks together in self-organizing but

            <SideBar title="Forming a caucus" theme="purple">
              <P>
                Caucuses are independent formations of members within the Local.
                They’re a big part of internal democracy. If you think we need
                to do more on a particular front, if you want to gather people
                who are interested in the same issues or shared experiences, or
                if you want to push the leadership to consider alternatives to
                the current path, a caucus might be what you’re looking for.
                Local caucuses have formed around socialist feminism,
                environmental justice, social housing, and the abolition of
                prisons and policing. (The website always has an up-to-date list
                of formally recognized caucuses.) We also have caucuses with
                more subtle missions, like the Craft Caucus.
              </P>
              <P>
                Any member can form a caucus, for any reason. If you want your
                caucus to be officially recognized (which means you get listed
                on the website) you’ll need to get together five members and a
                statement that includes the name and purpose of the caucus, and
                send it to the Local secretary.

              While we encourage self-organizing, there are still a couple of
              things where it’s important to get approval from the larger body
              of the membership (or their elected representatives).

              <Strong>ELECTORAL ENDORSEMENTS:</Strong> You can feel free to get
              involved in a campaign as an individual, but the big-tent nature
              of our org makes it important that the collective membership gets
              to vote on it before someone starts claiming a DSA endorsement.
              Official endorsements require a full meeting and vote of the
              general membership (or in fast-moving and/or emergency
              circumstances, a three-quarters vote from the Local Council.)

                <Strong>SPEAKING FOR THE GROUP:</Strong> Be mindful of when
                you’re representing the Local and when you’re speaking as an
                individual. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but basically, if
                you’re in communication with another organization, a business,
                or the press, feel free to mention you’re a member and speak
                your mind. There’s no muzzle here. Just make it clear you’re not
                speaking on behalf of the organization until you’re sure it’s a
                position approved by a democratic process. The Local Council
                approves official chapter representatives for the purposes of
                interacting with other organizations or within a coalition
                space. Local Council and general membership meetings vote to
                approve positions, events, and strategies for the chapter; any
                work done by caucuses or ad hoc members should be presented as
                such.

              What this means in practice is that we focus our all-important
              resources of member time and energy on democratically determined
              priorities, building expertise in the standing committees and
              project teams, while committee member conversations and caucus

              If you’ve gotten involved with the internal and/or external
              organizing committees (IOC and EOC) and find that there is a
              specific need that is not being met by existing teams, you can
              talk to an organizer about your ideas and work together to develop
              a proposal for the membership or Local Council to vote on. If
              there’s a specific organizational need that falls outside the
              EOC/IOC frameworks (in the same way that the treasurer and the
              secretary are necessarily council-level and independent), the
              Local Council can authorize the creation of an official working
              group by appointing two co-chairs, who will sit as nonvoting
              members on the Local Council. All proposals for the Local Council
              must be submitted by a member of the Local Council, but that
              doesn’t mean they have to write it themselves!
