              EBDSA consists entirely of its members—we are an all-volunteer
              group. Aside from a skeletal staff at the national level, that’s
              true for every chapter. Anything that’s being done, from phone
              banking to strategic planning to organizing childcare for
              canvassers, happens because someone made the time for it,
              alongside demands from work, our loves, and our homes.

              We’re here because it feels better to knock on doors than stare at
              Facebook for another hour. We’re here because the old world is

              Joining DSA will not make your life easier, though it may make it
              more fulfilling. You might radicalize your neighbors, get cussed
              out by overpaid political consultants, develop spaces for no-cost
              leisure, and shift what “common sense” consists of. At a DSA
              gathering, you might be knocking on doors, organizing meetings,
              hosting a neighborhood potluck, or showing someone the power they
              didn’t know they had. You might also find yourself stuffing
              envelopes, learning (or teaching) at a socialist education event,
              or watching kids for volunteers. Whatever it is, prepare to feel
              that what you’re doing matters and is worth the effort. (If you
              joined because you wanted to show off your superior knowledge of
              Marx or get into fights on the internet, you should probably
              revise your expectations.)

              As Democratic Socialists, we aim to build a mass movement.{" "}
              <Strong>For real, though. Massive.</Strong> That means knocking on
              doors and talking to people who come from very different social
              contexts. Anyone who wants to build a socialist future is welcome
              in DSA. If we’re going to get this right, it’s going to take
              kindness, unselfish curiosity, and a LOT of meetings. (Don’t worry
              if you can’t attend all the meetings—part of what we’re building
              is also a capacity for people to show up, contribute, and have a
              democratic say by whatever means are available for them.)

              Solidarity is a word that gets thrown around a lot. At its core,
              it’s a recognition that we are all in this together. When strikers
              a hundred years ago marched against the police, the Pinkertons,
              and anyone else trying to break them, this wasn’t an abstract
              concept: It was a survival principle. There was power in a united
              crowd. When British textile workers refused to work on slave
              cotton during the Civil War, or when varied liberation movements
              in the 1960s acted as one, they achieved things once considered
              unthinkable. Similarly, there’s a lot of value in setting aside
              one’s ego and showing up for the work to be done. Sometimes that
              means reaching out to (and learning from) other local
              organizations that have been fighting the good fight for a long
              time. Sometimes that means working within the chapter, or just
              being willing to have a deep conversation about the things we all
              fear, and why no one has to bear it alone.

            <P>
              We can express solidarity in a lot of ways. The big, public ones
              are easy to see. The quiet ones are harder. It’s remembering
              someone’s name and pronouns. It’s putting in a little extra effort
              to fold chairs and stack clipboards after the big event. It’s
              slowing yourself down during a heated argument and taking time to
              really listen to what someone is really saying, and where they’re
              coming from.
            </P>

              By doing the quiet things, we build an organization that is
              robust, resilient, and more prepared for the long haul. If we
              think about building socialism as a generation-long project, and
              maybe one that will outlive us, it changes how we consider things.
              When you recognize that you could be working with someone for
              years to come, it changes the way you communicate. We may disagree
              about the ways to get there, but the ways we disagree can allow
              for us to work together in the future.

              Caring about anything in this historical moment means facing up to
              crisis after crisis, from natural disasters to ICE raids to
              organized harassment. We can’t react well if we’re operating with
              a baseline of “anxious, lonely wrecks.” Reach out to people and
              aim for genuine human connection. When it comes to building trust
              and sustained dialogue, in-person meetings are better than phone
              calls, and phone calls are better than texting. Most forms are
              better than social media.

                A comrade is your partner in solidarity. It’s sort of like a
                teammate: They don’t have to be your friend, but there’s a
                shared recognition of being on the same side. As a
                multi-tendency organization with a broad spectrum of opinions
                and a culture of open expression, it can be easy to quickly find
                oneself in a heated debate. When disagreements arise, it’s
                important to remember that we’re all pulling for a better
                future. While far from an exhaustive list, here are some things
                we’ve found that help:

                  you’re being chal- lenged on something, try to be open to it
                  as a valid critique first. If you disagree with a tactic or
                  project someone proposes, remember that they are motivated by

                  It’s tempting to split the world into “only two choices” or

                  fundamentally boil down to “good/bad.” (This is referred to as
                  binary thinking.) Unfortunately, this also makes it easy to
                  separate into artificial forms of “us” and a “them,” and
                  harder to stay in solidarity.

                  eye out for how you can redistribute power in the

                  shutting down and give them on-ramps back in. If they said
